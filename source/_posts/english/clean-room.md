Today is Sunday, so I am very energetic.
So I decide to clean up my house.
First, I dust the tables, lamps and anther furniture.
Then I wipe the kitchen table.
I saw the carpet is filthy.
I take out the vacuum to vacuum it.
It's very convenient.
I clean floor in room by vacuum better than broom.  
Next is the bathroom.
I mop the bathroom floor, and I scrub the sink.
So far, I finished all of this cleaning.
I'm very satisfy for it.

After lunch.
I go to watch my favorite reality show that the rap of china. 
It's a contest in 50 rappers.
I like rap song in it.

There is nothing like watch TV show after hardworking.
